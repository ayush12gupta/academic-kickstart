I am a First year Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Chemistry, broadly interested in the areas of Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

This Semester(Jan20-Apr20) I explored various topics on Probabilistic ML such as Bayesian Inference, Non-Conjugacy and Conditional Conjugacy, Linear Models and Exponential Families, Latent Variable Models, Expectation Maximization Algorithm, Variational Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Implemented EM on a Gaussian Mixture Model on MNIST dataset. Built an Variational Autoencoder model on PyTorch. Built a Recommendor System using Bayesian Matrix Factorisation

I was also fascinated by Deep Learning. After learning the basics of Deep Learning, Lately i had been exploring Generative Adversarial Networks though I’m much less acquainted with the subject that I’d like to be. I hope to explore GAN rigorously in the future.
